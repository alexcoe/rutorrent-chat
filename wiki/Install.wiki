== Details ==

*Note:* to download/edit files in your web directory you most likely need either _*root*_ or _*sudo*_. Also your web directory and web user might differ from this guide.

cd /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/
}}}

download the plugin from SVN:

svn checkout http://rutorrent-chat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ chat

wget http://rutorrent-chat.googlecode.com/files/chat-2.0.tar.gz

rm chat-2.0.tar.gz
}}}

and change the ownership of the files to your web user:

chown -R www-user:www-user chat/
}}}


=== Configuration ===

If you want to change some of the configuration you can open up *conf.php* in your favorite editor (nano or vim or something) and there are the default options for all users. Users can later override these with their own preferences through the settings menu as described on the [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-chat/wiki/Overview overview] page.

You can now start using the plugin!
