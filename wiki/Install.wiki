= Introduction =

Here you can find information on how to install the chat plugin. Of course you need [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/ rutorrent] before you install this plugin. If you want to know more about the functionalities of this plugin you can look on the [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-chat/wiki/Overview overview] page.


== Details ==

*Note:* to download/edit files in your web directory you most likely need either _*root*_ or _*sudo*_. Also your web directory and web user might differ from this guide.

=== Installation ===

move to your rutorrent plugins directory:
{{{
cd /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/
}}}

download the plugin from SVN:
{{{
svn checkout http://rutorrent-chat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ chat
}}}

*or* download the plugin tarball and unpack it (make sure to check for the latest version on the [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-chat/downloads/list downloads] page):
{{{
wget http://rutorrent-chat.googlecode.com/files/chat-1.1.tar.gz
tar -zxf chat-1.1.tar.gz
rm chat-1.1.tar.gz
}}}

and change the ownership of the files to your web user:
{{{
chown -R www-user:www-user chat/
}}}


=== Configuration ===

If you want to change some of the configuration you can open up *conf.php* in your favorite editor (nano or vim or something) and there are the following options:

the location of the file where all messages are written to and where each users pulls the messages from to his/her own file (you probably don't need to change this):
{{{
$mainChatLog = dirname(__FILE__) . '/chat.log';
}}}

the time in seconds that the chat window should check for new messages when it's active (open):
{{{
$activeInterval = 1;
}}}

the time in seconds that the chat window should check for new messages when it's inactive (closed):
{{{
$inactiveInterval = 10;
}}}

do you want to enable smiles? TRUE for yes and FALSE for no:
{{{
$useSmileys = TRUE;
}}}

which smiley set do you want to use? At the moment of writing this there are 2 smiley sets available, use value 1 for round smileys and 2 for squared smileys:
{{{
$smileySet = 2;
}}}


=== Finished ===

You can now start using the plugin!
