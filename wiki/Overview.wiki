Overview of all functionalities of the chat plugin

= Introduction =

Here you can find the general information on the chat plugin including screenshots. If you are looking for the install guide you can go to the [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-chat/wiki/Install install] page.


= Details =

== The toolbar button ==

After installation a new button will be added to the ruTorrent toolbar (the one with the blue and green chat clouds):

Clicking this button will toggle the chat window:

== The chat window without smiley images ==

Depending on your smiley settings in the config file the chat could also be seen without image smileys:

== The smileys ==

If the smileys are enabled the user can click on the smileys link behind the "Add message" text and a new window with the available smileys will pop up.
When you hover over the smiley it tells you the "code" for the smiley or you can simply click the smiley and it will be appended to the message field.
There are currently two types of smileys (although very similar) available and the active type is defined in the config file:

== Clearing the chat ==

If a user has read all the messages (or doesn't want to read them) there is a link to clear the chat located behind the "Messages" text at the top of the chat window. When a user clicks on there a prompt will open with 3 options:

The options are quite simple: Cancel the operation, clear the chat temporarily so the current chat will be available again on a page reload or clear the chat permanent so the chat won't be available anymore even after a page reload.


== Updating ==

The update settings are defined in the config file and by default the chat will do an update every 10 seconds when inactive (closed) and every 1 second when active (opened).
If new messages are received and the chat is inactive it will automatically be opened.


== That's all ==

That's all the details there are (for now) on this plugin. If you are interested in using it you can go to the [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-chat/wiki/Install install] page to see how to install it.
