Overview of all functionalities of the chat plugin

= Introduction =

Here you can find the general information on the chat plugin including screenshots. If you are looking for the install guide you can go to the [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-chat/wiki/Install install] page


= Details =

After installation a new button will be added to the ruTorrent toolbar:

Clicking this button will toggle the chat window:

Depending on your smiley settings in the config file the chat could also be seen without image smileys:

If the smileys are enabled the user can click on the smileys link behind the "Add message" text and a new window with the available smileys will pop up.
There are currently two types of smileys (although very similar) available and the active type is defined in the config file:

If a user has read all the messages (or doesn't want to read them) there is a link to clear the chat located behind the "Messages" text at the top of the chat window. When a user clicks on there a prompt will open with 3 options:

The options are quite simple: Cancel the operation, clear the chat temporarily so the current chat will be available again on a page reload or clear the chat permanent so the chat won't be available anymore even after a page reload.


That's all the details there are (for now) on this plugin. If you are interested in using it you can go to the [http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-chat/wiki/Install install] page to see how to install it.
